# TIC TAC TOE - REACT NATIVE

### Functionality 

- Players can take turns placing their respective tokens (X or O) on the game board by clicking on the corresponding square.
- The game checks for a winner after each turn, and a message is displayed if a player has won or if the game is a draw.
- Players can reset the game to start a new round at any time by clicking the "Play Again" button (save current score).
- The "Play Again" button can also be used to clear the board after a game has been won or drawn.
- Players can reset the game and the score at any time by clicking the "Reset Score" button (same as "Play Again" buuton only reset the score in addition).
