# TIC TAC TOE - REACT NATIVE

- The game checks for a winner after each turn, and a message is displayed if a player has won or if the game is a draw.
- Players can reset the game to start a new round at any time by clicking the "Play Again" button (save current score).
- The "Play Again" button can also be used to clear the board after a game has been won or drawn.
